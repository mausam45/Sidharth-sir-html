    <h3>External file</h3>
    <p>An external file is a file managed by the operating system or a
         software product other than the program using it, containing data or text,
         and can be accessed and used by different applications. </p>
        <h3>Here's a more detailed breakdown:</h3>
         <p>
           <h4> Operating System Managed:</h4>
            External files are not directly created or managed by the specific program accessing them; instead, they exist independently within the operating system's file system. 
           <h4> Data Storage:</h4>
            They can hold various types of data, such as text, images, 
            or other structured information. 
           <h4> Examples:</h4>
            Common examples include text files, CSV files, spreadsheets, and images. 
           <h4> Access and Use:</h4>
            Programs can open, read, write, and modify external files, 
            depending on the file format and the program's capabilities. 
           <h4> External to a Program:</h4>
            The term "external" highlights that the file's existence and
             management are separate from the program's internal operations. 
           <h4> Sharing:</h4>
            External files can be shared between different programs,
             allowing for data exchange and collaboration. 
           <h4> Examples of External Files in Specific Contexts:</h4>
            SAS: SAS Help Center defines external files as being maintained by
             the operating system or other software, not SAS 
            [2].<br>IBM: IBM documentation defines external files as being managed by 
            the operating system [1, 3].<br>
            Web Development: External style sheets (CSS files) are external 
            files that contain styling rules for a webpage [14].<br>
            IBM Business Automation Workflow: IBM Business Automation Workflow 
            allows adding external files like images, style sheets, or JAR files to a
             process application [7].<br>
            NVivo: NVivo uses "externals" as proxy documents to represent data
             items that cannot be imported, such as books or websites [5, 6].</p>
